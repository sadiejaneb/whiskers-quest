# whiskers-quest

Unity dynamic melee combat game, leveraging C# for
intricate scripting and animation. This project highlights an advanced combat system, detailed character animations, and immersive audio integration, providing a rich player experience. Special attention was given to creating responsive NPC behaviors and customizable player interactions. The game is played as Whiskers the cat.  As Whiskers, you can punch multiple different enemies(bat, slime, and ghost) while exploring the neighborhood to collect gems.  You can collect stars for a temporary power-up to add 70 damage to Whiskers' punches for 10 seconds.  You can block incoming attacks to reduce damage.  Change Whiskers' face from 12 different options!  All scripts are in the scripts folder in assets/scripts.
